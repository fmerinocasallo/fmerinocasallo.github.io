# Where I come from and where I'm going :rewind: :fast_forward:

My curiosity for creating and understanding complex systems began with LEGO, designing structures piece by piece. Over time, my passion for building from logic and creativity evolved into the digital world when I discovered computing with an [iMac G3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMac_G3), the iconic computer with which Steve Jobs relaunched Apple after his return. That was the beginning of my journey into engineering.

What started as simple curiosity became a vocation[^1]. This growing interest led me to study **Computer Engineering**, where I discovered that, at its core, **technology is** not just about algorithms and systems but **about helping people** solve real problems and live healthier, more sustainable, and meaningful lives.

I began my professional career developing **processes** for the **massive analysis of genetic data**, identifying mutations associated with predisposition to various diseases. This work allowed me to specialize in data analysis and operations optimization, which are key skills in environments where data-driven decision-making is essential.

In 2022, I completed my **PhD in** Biomedical **Engineering**, focusing on modeling and predicting the cellular migratory response, a fundamental biological process not only for life and development but also associated with some of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality[^2]. During this stage, I developed computational models to replicate the behavior of these systems and [an autonomous methodology based on Bayesian optimization that facilitates the integration of theoretical studies with experimental data](https://bit.ly/3UHVPuY). **This project** advanced biomedical research and **added value in contexts where data modeling, analysis, and interpretation are key to decision-making**.

In 2023, I leaped to industry with Caphunters, a retail company specializing in fashion accessories :billed_cap: In this project, I honed my skills in **time series analysis**, applying **statistical models and artificial intelligence** to predict demand for their catalog, optimize inventories, and maximize sales.

Currently, I continue to refine my data management skills and expand my experience with key tools in the modern data ecosystem, including:
- Storage and analytics: [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery).
- Data orchestration: [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org) and [Kestra](https://kestra.io).
- Data loading and ingestion: [dlt](http://dlthub.com).
- Data transformation: [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com).
- Business analysis and visualization: [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com) and [Google Looker Studio](https://cloud.google.com/looker-studio).
- Deployment and automation: [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), and [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/).

# About Me :man_scientist: :man_technologist:

My family environment has deeply influenced my professional journey: I grew up surrounded by doctors and agricultural engineers, which sparked a **fascination for understanding complex systems**. As a result, I dedicated eight years to studying fundamental processes and systems for life and development. Note that these processes are also related to some of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality.

This combination of influences has given me an **analytical mindset**, an **insatiable curiosity**, and a **commitment to continuous growth**. But, above all, it has instilled in me a **vision focused on impact and value delivery**, principles that guide both my work and my approach to challenges.

Beyond the professional sphere, I strive to balance mind and body. **I am passionate about continuous learning** through [books](https://bit.ly/3N5FOuq), podcasts, meditation, cardio, and strength training :weight_lifting_man:.

Discovering new places and cultures with my family (both the original and the chosen one :heart:) is something I cherish greatly. I fondly remember our summer trips around Europe :fr::belgium::it::de::scotland::norway:, many by car :minibus:. I have a special connection with the [Royal Parks of London](https://www.royalparks.org.uk/)[^3] :deer::deciduous_tree: and the vibrant energy of New York City :taxi::statue_of_liberty: [^4]. I have already started planning my next trips to South Korea and Japan, and my list of pending destinations continues to grow.

My curiosity doesn't stop in the professional realm**; I am always exploring new areas of knowledge:

- **Agriculture and sustainability** :ear_of_rice:: As a child, I accompanied my grandfather to his walnut farm in the [ice or cold triangle](https://www.eltiempo.es/noticias/el-triangulo-del-frio-esta-en-espana-lo-conoces), which sparked my interest in agriculture and sustainability. Today, I maintain that connection by harvesting olives at the grove of a dear friend in [Ontinyent](https://www.comunitatvalenciana.com/en/valencia/ontinyent).
- **DIY and Repairs** :toolbox:: With the help of my builder father-in-law and a handyman friend, I have learned to repair appliances, tile bathrooms, and change floors. My next project will focus on home automation by automating the control of my house blinds.

**I am always open to new opportunities, learning, and interesting conversations. If you think we can discuss and exchange ideas or collaborate on a project, feel free to [reach out](mailto:francisco.merinocasallo+githubio@gmail.com?subject=[GitHub%20Page]%20Hello!)! :envelope_with_arrow:**

And if you have a book, podcast, or travel destination that you think I can't miss, I'd be happy to find out about it!
