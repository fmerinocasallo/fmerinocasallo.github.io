Hello! :grinning: :wave:

My name is Fran and I am from Zaragoza :city_sunrise:, although the COVID-19 lockdown caught me in the middle of a trip to the Valencian *terreta* and several years later, I am still here; matters of the heart :heart:

***

I am an excellence seeker and builder of processes that deliver the desired output :bullettrain_front: **and** make an optimal use of the available resources :airplane: **at the same time** :ship: I aim to transform data :microscope::thought_balloon: into actionable insights :pill::bulb: for healthier and more sustainable lives :camping: I leverage my acquired experience in R&D (bioinformatics :dna:, computational biology :microscope::desktop_computer:), computer engineering (automation :robot:, optimization :stopwatch:, [high-performance environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_computing) :rocket:) and data analysis :bar_chart: (9+ years of experience) while honing my skills in software architecture :building_construction:, data science and engineering :abacus::file_cabinet:, [DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) :hammer_and_wrench: and [cloud computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing) :cloud:

# Where I come from, where I'm going :rewind: :fast_forward:

When I was a kid, I started building LEGO sets in the real world and a few years later, during my teens, I made the leap into the digital world through an [iMac G3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMac_G3) (Apple's first major product release under CEO Steve Jobs following his return to the company he co-founded) :desktop_computer:

What started out as the hobbies of a kid [^1] and a teenager end up as a degree in Computer Engineering :mortar_board:

I spent the first two years of my professional career developing processes to analyze huge amounts of genetic data :dna: to identify mutations that increase susceptibility or predisposition to certain diseases.

In 2022, I defended my doctoral thesis :mortar_board: in Biomedical Engineering, focused on modeling and predicting the behavior of complex biological systems :crystal_ball::microscope: [During my PhD, I implemented an autonomous methodology based on Bayesian optimization techniques that facilitates the integration of theoretical studies with experimental data](https://bit.ly/3YWEfpp). Such integration is critical to continue unraveling the mysteries of life and the universe (:four::two:). I used this novel methodology to autonomously calibrate the computational models I was developing based on experimental data collected by my colleagues at the wet lab :desktop_computer::arrows_counterclockwise::microscope:

In 2023, I began my transition to the industry at [Caphunters](https://caphunters.com/en/) :billed_cap:, a retail company interested in predicting future demand for its products :crystal_ball::chart_with_upwards_trend: In this project, I honed my skills in data science through time series analysis using statistical and AI-based models.

I am currently gaining hands-on experience in data engineering ([PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) :file_cabinet:), DevOps (containerized systems and environments [[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) :whale2:], Infrastructure as Code [IaC; [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) :artificial_satellite:]) and cloud computing ([Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/)) :cloud:

# About me :man_scientist: :man_technologist:

The fact that my parents, my youngest sister and my partner are all doctors :stethoscope: probably favoured my predisposition to study some of the basic processes and systems of life for eight years. The fact that one of my grandfathers and his three sons (my uncles) are agricultural engineers :man_farmer: may have had something to do with it too :stuck_out_tongue:

I am a lifelong learner :open_book::memo::man_scientist: always looking for new growth opportunities :repeat::chart_with_upwards_trend::rocket:

> :sassy_man: If you want to verify how I went from knowing absolutely nothing about genetics, big data analysis, and multiple sequence alignment methods to publishing a paper on these topics, you can check out [this paper](https://bit.ly/3TEFkPV).

> :sassy_man: If you want to verify how I went from knowing absolutely nothing about biomechanics, cell biology, high-throughput environments, and Bayesian optimization methods to defending a doctoral thesis on these issues, you can check out [this document](https://bit.ly/3ZvdCZz).

> :sassy_man: If you want to verify how I went from knowing absolutely nothing about time series analysis to collaborating in the development of Darts, one of the most widely used open source libraries for prediction and anomaly detection in time series, you can check out [this link](https://bit.ly/4dd3HuU).

I like working with people because everyone has a unique story :bust_in_silhouette: Everyone is better than me at something and, therefore, there is something I can learn from all of them :100:

> :sassy_man: Throughout my professional career, I have enjoyed collaborating with people with remarkable stories and experiences such as [Elvira Mayordomo](http://webdiis.unizar.es/~elvira/), [Jorge Álvarez Jarreta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jorge-%C3%A1lvarez-jarreta-95a6162a/), [José Manuel García Aznar](https://m2be.unizar.es/people/jmgaraz/), [Mª José Gómez Benito](https://m2be.unizar.es/people/mjose-gomez-benito/), [Fabian Spill](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabian-spill-37504250/), [Cristina del Amo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cristinadelamomateos/), [Ismael González Valverde](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ismael-gonzalez-valverde/), [Gabriele Nasello](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gnasello/), [Silvia Hervás Raluy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/silviahervasraluy/), [Diego Saínz de Mena](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diego-sainz-de-mena), [Inês Gonçalves](https://www.linkedin.com/in/inesggoncalves/), [Eduardo Sánchez Burillo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eduardo-s%C3%A1nchez-burillo-2638b8194/), [Javier Briz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/javier-briz-3a7a0a23/) and [Rafael Redrado](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rafaelredrado), among many others. They all gave me great lessons :orange_heart:

I an an avid team player :busts_in_silhouette: who greatly enjoys collaborating :handshake: and learning from his colleagues to achieve shared goals :dart:

> :sassy_man: Two of the research projects I developed during my PhD serve as an example of my appreciation for teamwork and collaboration with other colleagues with complementary experiences and skills:
> 1. [Publication on a methodology to automate the integration of computational models with experimental data](https://bit.ly/3ZC66w7).
> 2. [Publication on the actors involved in the cell migration process](https://bit.ly/3zww1KQ).

I have enjoyed both the role of mentor :man_teacher: and mentee :man_student:

> :sassy_man: As an example of my experience as a mentor, check out the undergraduate thesis of [Alejandro Modrego](https://bit.ly/4eAGmnV) and [Benjamín Real Ruiz](https://bit.ly/4eh4b4j) that I co-supervised during my PhD.

> :sassy_man: As an example of my experience as a mentee and my ability to become an expert in a specific topic (in this case, modeling complex biological systems to predict their behavior) [my PhD thesis](https://bit.ly/3ZvdCZz).

I always try to keep strategic goals in mind :chart_with_upwards_trend: without undermining attention to detail :mag:

> :sassy_man: An example of my strategic vision is my collaboration with:
> 1. Industrial partners such as [SigOpt](https://sigopt.org/) (platform for optimizing models based on artificial intelligence at scale, [acquired in 2020 by Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/sigopt-to-scale-ai-productivity-performance.html)).
> 2. Colleagues from the academic world such as [Rubén Martínez Cantín (expert in machine learning and Bayesian optimization)](https://webdiis.unizar.es/~rmcantin/index.php) and [Yago Juste Lanas (biotechnologist and researcher with extensive experience in the mechanobiology wet lab)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yagojustelanas/).
>
> The result of this collaboration was [this joint publication](https://bit.ly/3ZC66w7) during my PhD in Biomedical Engineering.

> :sassy_man: Consider as an example of my attention to detail [this bug report](https://bit.ly/4eQwgiS) :bug: in the official repository of the open source library [Darts](https://unit8co.github.io/darts/) for prediction and detection of anomalies in time series. Note that I also fixed this bug in [this pull request](https://bit.ly/4dd3HuU).

To fulfill these purposes, I strive for clean :sponge: and simple :beginner: code, and to document :pencil: not only code but also processes and goals.

> :sassy_man: An example of my efforts to keep the code clean and simple is [this Python module for managing (monthly) NYC yellow cab trip data and ingesting it into a PostgreSQL server](https://bit.ly/3N7fBMd).

> :sassy_man: Take the following report as examples of my efforts to document not only code:
> 1. [How to containerize and secure a PostgreSQL server and pgAdmin](https://bit.ly/3N6ofKU).
> 2. [How to use infrastructure as code on Google Cloud Platform](https://bit.ly/4eHnXWA).

As someone with a growth mindset, I seek opportunities for skills training :writing_hand:, learning new techniques :construction_worker_man:, gaining experience with novel technologies :hammer_and_wrench:, and developing and implementing best practices :nerd_face:

***

Personally, I strive for a healthy mind in a healthy body. To do this, I follow a diet based on a diversified list of [books](https://bit.ly/3N5FOuq) :books: and podcasts :studio_microphone:, meditation :lotus_position_man:, and cardio :running_man: :swimming_man: and strength :weight_lifting_man: training.

I enjoy discovering new places :national_park::cityscape: and cultures :japanese_ogre: :european_castle: with my family (the original and the chosen one :heart:). I fondly remember travelling around Europe :fr::belgium::it::de::scotland::norway: during the summer holidays with my family, many of them by car :minibus: I acknowledge a special relationship with the [Royal Parks in London](https://www.royalparks.org.uk/) [^2] :deer::deciduous_tree: and New York City :taxi::statue_of_liberty: [^3] I have already started planning a trip to South Korea :kr: and Japan :jp::shinto_shrine:, with many others to come.

My passion for learning about (almost) anything also extends to the personal sphere:

1. When I was a kid (and a teenager), I often visited one of my grandfather's walnut orchards located near a small town within the well-known [Spanish ice triangle](https://fascinatingspain.com/place-to-visit/what-to-see-in-aragon/what-to-see-in-teruel/the-ice-triangle-this-is-the-coldest-corner-of-spain/) with him. It is because of him and my uncles, all three agricultural engineers like their father, that I am also interested in agriculture :seedling::ear_of_rice: I no longer harvest walnuts in [Daroca](https://www.spain.info/en/destination/daroca/), but in 2023 I established the annual tradition of harvesting olives on the olive grove :olive: that a dear friend has in [Ontinyent](https://www.comunitatvalenciana.com/en/valencia/ontinyent).
2. With the assistance of my father-in-law and a particularly skilled friend, I aspire to become a handyman inside and outside the house :toolbox: Among other things, I've fixed a hair dryer and an electric water heater that had a broken thermostat :thermometer: I've also tiled the walls of the bathroom :bathtub: at home and changed the floor in the living room :couch_and_lamp: at my parents' house just in time for Christmas :christmas_tree:
